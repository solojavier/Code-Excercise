Cyrusinnovation Code Test
====================

This exercise will provide us with an initial gauge of your Java skills, and more importantly, your overall software development ability. It's not meant to be long or tricky or complicated. It's not timed, so you can take as long as you need.

This is the [code test webpage](http://cyrusinnovation.com/code_test).

Repo has the following structure:

	* /bin: 			: Executable jar with required files
	* /source			: Source code
	* /doc 				: Javadoc files source code and bin used only to run the application. 

To run this project, go to /bin and run jar using this command:

	java -jar Cyrusinnovation-Code-Exercise.jar

It print in console message "Done." and output_files/model_output.txt will be generated. If error occurs it will be printed in console.

JUnit (4.9) tests were written for this project also, so you can run them with eclipse IDE or manually. Also junit-addons (1.4) was used, required jars are found under /source/lib
